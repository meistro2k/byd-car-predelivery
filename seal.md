# BYD Seal Car Pre-Delivery Checklist

This checklist is designed to help new buyers thoroughly inspect their new BYD Seal car before taking delivery. While it caters to the Australian market, most checks are relevant to worldwide Seal deliveries. 

## Pre-Delivery Check Items
- [ ] **Phone with camera and torch capabilities**
- [ ] **USB-A-to-Apple (certified) Lightning, or USB-A-to-USB-C data cable** - to test Apple CarPlay/Android Auto functionality
- [ ] **One small 240v appliance** - to test the V2L capabilities (e.g travel hair dryer)
- [ ] **[Print this checklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meistro2k/byd-car-predelivery/main/seal.md)** - bring it on delivery day

## Pre-Delivery Checks

Allocate **30 minutes** to inspect the car and go through these checks before you sign and take delivery.

### Exterior

- [ ] **Paintwork Damage** - inspect for swirl marks, scratches, stone chips, and surface damage from exposure to external environments or improper pre-delivery cleaning
- [ ] **Undercarriage & Wheel Arches Condition** -  Some customers (especially in tropical regions) have had their pre-delivered cars held in sub-optimal holding yard conditions with the existence of mud and flood damage.
- [ ] **Charge flap paint consistentcy** - Some customers have noticed the metallic speckles on their charge flaps are missing, and do not have the shimmer when compared to the rest of the body paintwork (mostly reported on Cosmos Black paint cars). 
- [ ] **Inspect for fine scratches on the lens of exterior cameras** - Some customers don't realise there are hairline cracks till well after delivery
- [ ] **Front/rear window wipers and washer operation** - ensure appropriately sized wiper blades have been installed
- [ ] **NFC card functionality** - Unlock the car via the NFC reader on the driver-side door mirror. Start the car by putting it on the NFC placeholder, marked on the centre console armrest.
- [ ] **Inspect for any wheel damage** - ensure NO curb rashes are on the wheels during the transportation process
- [ ] **Inspect all windows for scratch marks** - recommend the use of a phone torch. Some users have reported scratches on the back window.

### Interior

- [ ] **Ensure air conditioning temperature is cold** - Ensure 'Auto A/C mode' setting is on "Comfort Normal" at NOT "Eco" mode. Have air flow directly pointing at you. Test at max fan and lowest temperature settings for 5 minutes. Some owners have reported insufficient refrigerant or leaking gassed systems.
- [ ] **Check for interior stains** - especially on touch-sensitive surfaces like the centre console and seats.
- [ ] **Check the Odometer** - Anything between 8km & 30km is acceptable. It's not a bit deal if it's slightly over.

### Infotainment

- [ ] **Ensure that "Transport mode" is turned off** - via the shortcut menu (car will reportedly stop running after ~5kms of driving). The shortcut icon should be removed pre-delivery or removed after to prevent putting the car back into transport mode.
- [ ] **SIM card is activated successfully** (Utility Tools > Data)
- [ ] **Test DAB+ to confirm that the SIM card is activated and mobile data is operating normally**
- [ ] **Test AM/FM Radio for correct radio antenna operation**
- [ ] **Test that Navigation app guidance voice can be heard** - some cars have issues with no guidance audio being heard (software version `2310`) while others can only hear the guidance audio coming out of the left-front speaker.
- [ ] **Test successful operation of wired Apple Car Play and/or wireless Android Auto**
- [ ] **Check tyre pressure monitor screen** - ensure that tyres are correctly inflated and matches the pressure label attached below the car's left B-pillar.
- [ ] **Check camera picture quality** - Press the camera button on the steering wheel, and toggle through all cameras to verify that all images are clear
- [ ] **Check that the 3-month/5,000km complimentary service reminder schedule has been set**

### Accessories

- [ ] **Granny charger cable is included**
- [ ] **Test the successful operation of the granny charger**
- [ ] **V2L adaptor is included**
- [ ] **Test the successful operation of the V2L adaptor**
- [ ] **2pcs roof shades (front & rear) are included**
- [ ] **Tyre repair kit**

### Paperwork

- [ ] **Sales contract, Tax Invoice, and Registration papers** - payment dates must be noted for those claiming Government incentives such as EV rebates
- [ ] **Confirmation of Mobile app activation** - confirm with your sales representative that they have or will register your email for access to the BYD mobile app. This process may take up to 2 weeks.

## Post-Delivery Checks

- [ ] **Charge car at public charging station** - Ensure that DC charging of your car is successful. [Jolt](https://jolt.com.au/) currently has 7kWh of free charging daily.
- [ ] **BYD Mobile App** - Set a calendar reminder for two weeks to follow up with BYD customer service if your email address is still not recognised when registering on the BYD App.
- [ ] **Roadside Assistance, complimentary 12-month access** - Set a calendar reminder for 1 month to follow up with BYD customer service if you have not received a confirmation email for the activation of your complimentary 12-month roadside assistance plan.
- [ ] **Test extended offline NFC card usage** - Settle the car into a sleep state by locking and leaving it alone for 15 minutes. Attempt to unlock the car via the NFC reader. Some users have reported the NFC unlock functionality does not work until the car is woken up via an unlock action with the key.

By completing this checklist, you can ensure that your new BYD Seal is being delivered to you in the best condition possible.
